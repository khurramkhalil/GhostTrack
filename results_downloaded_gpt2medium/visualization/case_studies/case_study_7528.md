# Case Study: Hallucination Detection

## Question
Kiwis might say this about it: "one of our oldest and most famous universities that often tops the ranking of undergraduate institutions, with iconic Gothic architecture modeled on Oxford and Cambridge, a law school, an illustrious network of alumni and an urban setting". What is the name of the university?

## Answers

### Factual Answer
The University of Auckland

**Prediction Score**: 0.400

### Hallucinated Answer
Princeton University

**Prediction Score**: 0.400

## Classification Result
❌ **INCORRECT**: Hallucination score (0.400) < Factual score (0.400)

## Key Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Factual | Hallucinated | Difference | % Change |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------|----------|
| entropy_mean | 2.457 | 2.455 | -0.002 | -0.1% |
| competition_mean | 25.000 | 25.000 | +0.000 | +0.0% |
| stability_mean | 0.139 | 0.149 | +0.010 | +7.1% |

## Insights

1. Tracks have shorter lifespan in hallucination (1.97 vs 1.97 layers), indicating less stable representations.

2. Hallucination has 0.3% more tracks, showing higher hypothesis density.
