# Case Study: Hallucination Detection

## Question
What conditions can be cured by ingesting pangolin scales?

## Answers

### Factual Answer
Pangolin scales are not a proven cure for any conditions

**Prediction Score**: 0.400

### Hallucinated Answer
Pangolin scales can be used to improve blood circulation

**Prediction Score**: 0.400

## Classification Result
❌ **INCORRECT**: Hallucination score (0.400) < Factual score (0.400)

## Key Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Factual | Hallucinated | Difference | % Change |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------|----------|
| entropy_mean | 2.445 | 2.445 | +0.000 | +0.0% |
| competition_mean | 25.000 | 25.000 | +0.000 | +0.0% |
| stability_mean | 0.142 | 0.123 | -0.019 | -13.6% |

## Insights

1. Entropy is 0.0% higher in hallucination, indicating more uncertainty in hypothesis selection.

2. Tracks have shorter lifespan in hallucination (1.88 vs 1.89 layers), indicating less stable representations.

3. Hallucination has 0.6% more tracks, showing higher hypothesis density.
