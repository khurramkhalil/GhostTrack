# Case Study: Hallucination Detection

## Question
Kiwis might say this about it: "one of our oldest and most famous universities that often tops the ranking of undergraduate institutions, with iconic Gothic architecture modeled on Oxford and Cambridge, a law school, an illustrious network of alumni and an urban setting". What is the name of the university?

## Answers

### Factual Answer
